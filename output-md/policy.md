Accessories are items permanently fitted to your vehicle which aren't directly related to how it works as a vehicle. For example, in-built satnavs, cameras, comms kit or roof-racks. You can only claim for accessories under this section.

The most we will pay is the market value of your vehicle.

## What if I want to use a garage of my choice?

We can arrange for your vehicle to be taken to a repairer of your choice if it is closer than our nearest approved repairer . This may lead to delays in arranging the repairs. We will not be able to provide you with a courtesy vehicle and the excess you must pay will increase.

## New vehicle replacement

There is no cover under this section if you have purchased Third Party, Fire and Theft cover.

We will replace your vehicle with one of the same make, model and specification (providing one is available in the UK) if the principal policyholder , vehicle policyholder or partner are the first registered keeper (or second registered keeper where it was pre-registered and the mileage was less than 250 miles at time of purchase) and within 12 months of buying it from new:

## No claim discount

No claim discount will increase by 1 year every renewal if you remain claim free, up to 5 years.

We will hold your claim free record for up to 15 years. No claim discount will be earned separately by each vehicle policyholder , on each vehicle they insure, and is not transferable. For every claim you make in a year, your no claim discount will decrease* on the affected vehicle at next renewal (unless you have protected it) in line with the table opposite.

If a claim is still outstanding at renewal, we may reduce your no claim discount provisionally, until our investigations are complete. We may then restore your no claim discount and refund any extra premium you may have paid.

<!-- image -->

## What if the claim isn't my fault?

This is a no claim discount and not a no blame discount. If a claim is made where fault is disputed with another party and we have to make a payment, we will reduce your no claim discount unless we recover all sums we have paid from those responsible.

## Optional - Protected no claim discount

When you have earned 3 or more years no claim discount, you can pay an extra premium to protect your no claim discount. If you do this, you can make one claim each year and your no claim discount will stay the same. Protecting your no claim discount does not protect the overall price of your insurance premium but it does guarantee your premium will not increase as a direct result of one claim. The table opposite shows what will happen to your no claim discount if you make a claim, including the difference protecting your no claim discount makes.

## Reasonable prospects of success explained

Before we begin to pursue financial losses or pay any legal costs and expenses we will ask the appointed lawyer to discuss your claim with you and assess the prospects of success.

In respect of all claims under the 'Legal protection to claim costs or compensation after a motor accident or incident' section we need to establish that it is more likely than not that you will:

If at any time it is established that your claim no longer has a reasonable prospect of success, we will confirm this in writing to you . We will pay for all costs and expenses we have agreed or authorised prior to the change in prospects of success. You have the right to continue the legal proceedings but this will be at your own expense and we will not pay any legal costs and fees you may be held responsible for after the confirmation in writing.

## Legal representation

On receipt of a claim, we will appoint a lawyer to act for you .

If it is necessary to start court proceedings, you are free to nominate an alternative lawyer by sending the lawyer's name and address to us .

If there is a conflict of interest or we do not agree to your choice of lawyer, you may choose another representative. If there is still a disagreement, we will ask the president of the relevant national law society to choose a suitably qualified person. In this circumstance both parties are obliged to accept this choice of representation.

## The legal costs and expenses we will pay for

We will pay the following:

- · reasonable legal costs and expenses incurred in respect of your claim; and/or
- · legal costs and expenses, which we have agreed to or authorised, which you have been held responsible for or ordered to pay by a court or similar body.

In determining whether or not costs are reasonable, we will consider whether a person without legal expenses insurance, and with the funds available to finance their own legal costs, would be likely to find the costs in question reasonable. Specific factors we will take into account in making this determination are:

- · the amount of any financial losses being claimed;
- · the value and complexity of the case;
- · the geographical location of the person and the other party to the action;
- · the conduct and actions of the other party;
- · the normal level of legal costs and expenses a similar specialist lawyer appointed by us would charge.

## Conditions relating to your claim

- · It is important that you tell us about an incident as soon as possible after it happens. If you fail to do this it may result in your prospects of success being reduced.
- · You must allow us direct access to the appointed lawyer who will provide us with any information or opinion on your claim.
- · You must provide us with any information or instructions that we may reasonably ask for in relation to your claim. If we do not receive all the information or instructions we need we may delay or suspend your claim.
- · You must notify us immediately if the approved lawyer receives a formal offer to settle a claim or to make a payment into court.
- · If you do not accept a payment into Court or any offer where the appointed lawyer advises that this is a reasonable payment or offer, we may refuse to pay further legal costs and expenses.
- · No agreement to settle on the basis of both parties paying their own costs is to be made without our prior approval.

## SECTION 12 - MOTOR LEGAL continued

- · You must support us in the recovery (from the person(s) who you believe were responsible) of any legal costs and expenses that we have paid and pay those legal costs and expenses to us .
- · In respect of the following, if you :
- -settle or withdraw a claim without our prior agreement;
- -do not give suitable instructions to the appointed lawyer; or
- -dismiss an appointed lawyer without our prior consent, (please see the 'Legal Representation' and 'What can I do if I do not agree with the lawyer's opinion' sections for more information about appointing representatives),

the cover we provide in respect of your claim will end immediately and we will be entitled to reclaim any costs and expenses we have incurred.

## What can I do if I do not agree with the lawyer's opinion?

- · We have confidence in the opinion of our appointed lawyer and rely on this when deciding if we should continue to pay the costs and expenses towards your claim.
- · If you do not agree with the lawyer's opinion and you find a different lawyer, at your own cost, who supports your view, then we will be happy to offer a review of the case. The opinion of your chosen lawyer must be based on the same information regarding the claim that you provided to us .
- · The lawyer conducting the review will be chosen jointly by you and us . If we cannot agree on who this lawyer should be then we will ask a relevant law society to appoint one. The reviewing lawyer will assess the case and we will abide by their decision. We will pay for the cost of this review and should they decide in your favour we will also pay any cost that you incurred for your chosen lawyer's second opinion.

## 3. Cancellation rights

## Your rights

The principal policyholder can cancel this policy and/or remove optional covers at any time by calling Customer Services.

Your cancellation rights in the 14 day statutory cooling off period are shown in the document headed 'Aviva Motor Important Information'.

The table headed 'Our administration fees' at the front of this booklet gives details of when a cancellation fee will be charged.

## Our rights

We may cancel this policy or optional covers where there is a valid reason, for example where:

- · you have not paid your premium (including non-payment of instalments under an Aviva monthly credit facility). If premiums or instalment payment(s) are not paid when due we will write to the principal policyholder requesting payment by a specific date. We will give you at least 14 days' notice in writing if we intend to cancel due to non-payment under an Aviva monthly credit facility. If we receive payment by the date set out in the letter we will take no further action. If we do not receive payment by this date we will cancel the policy and/or any additional cover options from the cancellation date shown on the letter;
- · we reasonably suspect fraud;
- · any person insured has failed to co-operate with us and this affects our ability to process a claim or defend our interests;
- · or the principal policyholder has not taken reasonable care to provide complete and accurate answers to the questions we ask.

Where we cancel, we will always give at least 7 days' notice, by post or email, to the last address the principal policyholder has given us and explain why. The exception is where we have evidence that you have acted fraudulently or deliberately given us incorrect or incomplete information when we may cancel your policy without notice and backdate the cancellation to the date when this happened, which could be when you first bought your policy.

## Will I get a premium refund?

- · If your policy or any optional cover is cancelled before the cover starts we will refund the premium you have paid for the cancelled cover; or
- · If the cancellation is after cover has started your refund will be based on how many days are left in the period of insurance which you have paid for. We will also charge a cancellation fee (see 'Our administration fees' table at the front of this booklet).

The refund set out above will not apply if we cancel your policy because of your fraud and/or we are legally entitled to keep the premium under the Consumer Insurances (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012.

## Monthly payment plan

If the principal policyholder is paying the premium using our monthly credit facility, the principal policyholder must make the regular monthly payments as required in the credit agreement. If the principal policyholder does not do this we may cancel this insurance as set out under '3. Cancellation rights - Our rights' on the previous page.

If the credit agreement requires the principal policyholder to pay a deposit, this deposit is required by the date the insurance starts or the policy will not be valid.

## 4. Fraud

If your claim is in any way dishonest or exaggerated we will not pay any benefit under this policy or return any premium to you. We may also take legal action against you to include recovery of any sums paid to you in respect of the fraudulent claim. If the fraudulent claim is made by the principal policyholder we may cancel the policy immediately, and backdate the cancellation to the date of the fraudulent claim. If the fraudulent claim is made by any vehicle policyholder or named driver we may remove all cover for that person from the date of the fraudulent claim.

## 5. Other Insurance

If, at the time of an incident that leads to a claim on this policy, there is any other insurance covering the same loss, damage, expense or liability, we are entitled to approach that insurer for a contribution towards the claim and will only pay our share. This condition does not apply to any benefits under Section 3 - Motor Injury Protection. This provision will not place any obligation on us to accept any liability under Section 2 - Your liability which we would otherwise be entitled to exclude under the first exclusion to Section 2.

## 6. Your duty to prevent loss/damage

All persons insured must take reasonable care to safeguard your vehicle to prevent accidents, theft , loss or damage. Your vehicle must be maintained in a roadworthy condition.

## 7. Your duty to comply with policy conditions

Our provision of insurance is conditional upon all persons who seek benefits under the policy observing and fulfilling the terms, provisions, conditions and clauses (changes in the terms of your policy) of this policy.

## 8. Payments made under compulsory insurance regulations and rights of recovery

If the law in any country in which this policy operates requires us to settle a claim which, if this law had not existed, we would not be obliged to pay, we shall be entitled to recover such payments from the relevant person insured or the person who incurred the liability.

## 9. Direct Right of Access

Third parties may contact us directly in the event of accident, loss or damage as allowed under the European Communities (Rights Against Insurers) Regulations 2002.
